When we're stuck in a rut, one way out is to change our environment. This could mean our physical environment (going outside) or our digital environment (consuming something different).

I assembled this collection of requests for startups and side project ideas to kickstart the creative part of the brain. Sometimes it just needs a nudge in the right direction.

None of these ideas are my own. They're from [RFS 100 newsletters](https://rfs100.substack.com/), [My First Million podcasts](https://thehustle.co/my-first-million-podcast/), disparate Twitter threads, and maybe you. Feel free to [email me](mailto:eleetyson@gmail.com?subject=ðŸ‘‹) suggestions and I'll get them added.

This frontend is written in React and uses Redux for state management. The backend is a simple Rails API with a Postgres database, hosted on Heroku. The loading animations are courtesy of Bryan Vogel via [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/). Shoutout to Preet Shihn also for his work on [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/) -- I used its React wrapper to create a simple highlighter animation.
